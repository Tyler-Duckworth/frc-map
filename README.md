# FRC-Map

An improved version of [this](https://github.com/lnstempunks/frcmap) web app.

This app updates the API version of TheBlueAlliance and switches the map provider to Mapbox.

Due to some recent updates in the framework and its existing components, there are some errors with the API, but the appearance builds fine.
